# Module 2 Challenge: Password Generator 

## Description
Given that the user is in need of a new/secure password, I created a password generator using Javascript. This password generator takes input, such as desired length and types of characters, from the user and produces a random output that is displayed into the page password textbox. The criteria of this project included prompting the user for length (range 8-128 characters), and allowing the user to include lowercase/uppercase, numbers, and special symbols in their password. For this code I took extra precaution to ensure that at least one character from each desired category was guaranteed to be in the final password and added alerts if user input was inappropriate.
